            <p>Linux can be incredibly painful to work with.

            </p>
            <p>For example, I&#39;m dealing with file permission errors. These are something so basic but my guess is millions of Linux users run into file permission errors every week.

            </p>
            <p>This one was super frustrating.

            </p>
            <p>I created a new user and group, created a folder as that user, added my current user to that group, changed the file permissions on that folder to be 770, so that the owner and group owner could do everything, and then expected that to work.

            </p>
            <p>It was mind bogglingly. I lost hours on this. No hint whatsoever about what was wrong.

            </p>
            <p>As it turns out, you need to log out of your shell and log back in for group changes to take effect. Nothing hinted at this. It seems like this must happen all the time. How can something so basic go overlooked for so long?

            </p>
            <p>I wish the Linux ecosystem borrowed more from Mac OS X and Windows in sending usage reports upstream. Then errors like this can be identified and the basics cleaned up.

            </p>
            <p>I guess we get what we pay for.

            </p>
            <p>It can be real frustrating sometimes. Really hope Ubuntu and Canonical keep chugging along. (As well as Red Hat). Linux really needs some good business sense.</p>
