            <p>For the third time in my life I&#39;ve gotten a Macbook. The previous two times I returned them. I&#39;m hoping the third time is a charm.

            </p>
            <p>After a week I&#39;m finally starting to get used to it. I&#39;m starting to really customize it and that seems to make all the difference. I&#39;ve removed nearly everything from the dock, added a bunch of things to my bash profile, and a
                friend at work gave me a crash course in Textmate.

            </p>
            <p>I&#39;ve downloaded a program called <a href="http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/">Sizeup</a>, which not only emulates the awesome &quot;Snap&quot; feature of Windows 7, but in fact is even better. It gives you the left/right 50% snap
                feature just like in Win7, but also lets you snap things into top/bottom and even snap things into quadrants. Pretty nice software.

            </p>
            <p>Firefox is my favorite of the 3 browsers on the Mac. I loved Chrome on Windows because it was so fast, but this Air is so blazing fast that running Firefox or Chrome on Mac makes little difference.

            </p>
            <p>I&#39;ve added the Secret Preferences menu and turned &quot;show all hidden files and folders&quot; on. I hate not seeing everything in a folder.

            </p>
            <p>I created an alias &quot;dsdelete&quot; to quickly recursively delete DS_Store hidden files (helpful when zipping folders for sharing).

            </p>
            <p>I learned the &quot;open .&quot; command and changed the terminal color scheme.

            </p>
            <p>I installed RubyMine and Web Developer Toolbar and Tamper Data and Charles and Dropbox. I&#39;m still trying out VMWare Fusion and haven&#39;t decided if I want it yet.

            </p>
            <p>I&#39;ve slowly gotten used to the keyboard. I tried spaces but have turned it back off for now. Expose I hardly use yet.

            </p>
            <p>All in all, I&#39;m really enjoying the speed, instant on, the light weight of the computer, Ruby on a Mac (doing Rails dev on Windows is a pain), having a real terminal(cygwin is great, but native is better), and the fact that 50% of my CPU
                isn&#39;t dedicated to fighting viruses. I&#39;m still developing slower on this machine but hoping that my speed will improve with time.

            </p>
            <p>I&#39;d say the odds at this point are 60-40 in favor of me sticking with it this time.</p>
