            <p>I have used the same Gmail address as my main email for over 5 years.

            </p>
            <p>Since then:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>I&#39;ve made dozens of other emails that forward to this address.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>I&#39;ve signed up for hundreds of web apps and newsletters.</li>
                </ul>
                As a result, my Gmail account gets inundated with email. Here are the stats:

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>16,054 unread emails in my inbox</li>
                <li>29,236 emails total in my inbox</li>
                <li>?? who knows how many total emails in my archive</li>
                <li>3.683 GB of email</li>
                <li>Using 49% of my Gmail quota</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My Gmail account had become a firehose.

            </p>
            <p>This was bad for two reasons.

            </p>
            <p>First, I started missing important emails. Not many, but a few per month. I had to write my own <a href="http://github.com/breck7/checkmygmail/">simple Bayes filter</a> to find them.

            </p>
            <p>Second, I couldn&#39;t do what most people do: use my inbox as a &quot;todo&quot; list. Most people immediately archive or delete an email when they&#39;re done with it. This is a great organizational trick. I wanted to do this again.

            </p>
            <p>I considered starting a new email address and giving it out to important people, but that seemed like it would make my life more complex.

            </p>
            <p>As it turns out, the solution was simple.

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Started liberally using the &quot;Spam&quot; button. I started clicking Spam on pretty much any type of mass email that wasn&#39;t very interesting to me. Will be interesting to see how this plays out.</li>
                <li>Starred all the recent messages that I still had to deal with.</li>
                <li>Archived all 29,000+ of my gmail messages at once.</li>
                <li>Went back to the starred folder and moved the important messages to inbox.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Notes
